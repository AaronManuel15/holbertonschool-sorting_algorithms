#0x1A: C - Big O and Sorting Algorithms
A Holberton School project in Course PP1300.

## About the Project
This project is mean to teach us specifically about 4 different sorting algorithms. What Big O notation is, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input and what is a stable sorting algorithm. The four sorting algorithms we will cover are bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort and quick sort.

## Bubble Sort
The bubble sort algorithm sorts by iterating through the list linearly. If the next number is less than the previous number then they swap. It will continue looping through the array until it is sorted.

The Big O notation for best case, average case, and worst case are as follows:
* O(n)
* O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* O(n<sup>2</sup>)
